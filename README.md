# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to the `Extra-Projects-ML` repository! This repository is a collection of various machine learning and deep learning projects, demonstrating the application of different algorithms and techniques to solve real-world problems.

## üåü Overview

This collection showcases a range of projects from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Computer Vision for medical imaging analysis. Each project is contained within its own notebook or directory, providing a focused look at a specific problem and its solution.

## üìÇ Projects Included

Here is a list of the projects you can find in this repository:

### ü©∫ Medical Imaging & Healthcare
* **Histopathologic Cancer Detection using CNNs**: A project utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect cancer from histopathologic scan images.
* **Lung Cancer Analysis & Accuracy 96.4%**: An analysis of lung cancer data, featuring a model with 96.4% accuracy.
* **Skin Cancer Detection**: A model designed to detect skin cancer from images.
* **Skin cancer model (97.88%) accuracy**: A high-accuracy model for skin cancer classification.
* **Trent Prediction analysis.ipynb**: A predictive analysis project, likely related to healthcare data.
* **TAP HCD 120924**: Another project related to Histopathologic Cancer Detection.

### üí¨ Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* **zomato_review_analysis_using_NLP_project.ipynb**: A project that performs sentiment analysis or other NLP tasks on Zomato restaurant reviews.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To explore these projects, you can clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/Extra-Projects-ML.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/Extra-Projects-ML.git)
    ```
    *(Replace `YourUsername` with your actual GitHub username)*

2.  **Navigate to the directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Extra-Projects-ML
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment. The dependencies may vary slightly between projects, but you can start by installing the most common libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras opencv-python jupyter notebook
    ```
    *For specific projects, you might need to install other libraries. Check the individual notebooks for any special requirements.*

4.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    This will open a new tab in your web browser, where you can navigate to and open any of the project notebooks (`.ipynb` files).
